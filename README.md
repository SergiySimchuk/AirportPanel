# AirportPanel
My degree project
It is a small web site with two pages.
1. Flight panel - for customers.
  Customer can choose a flight (search by flight number, departure/arrive date  departure/arrive airport), buys the tickets, registers and save his passengers or login and use saved previosly passengers.
2. For staff - service page, where staff users can create all catalog information (Airports, terminals, gates, price classes) and create new or modify existing Flights.

Used:
MediatR,
AutoMapper,
for frontend used bootstrap and Javascript.

PS. It is not finished, I`ll work to improve it.
